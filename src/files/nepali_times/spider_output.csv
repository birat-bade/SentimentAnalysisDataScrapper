https://www.nepalitimes.com/must-see/the-party/,The party,"May 18, 2018","Last week’s column lamented the reviewer’s plight when having a real paucity of recent films to choose from, a drought that comes a few times a year. At this point, I revert to a store of contemporary films that were pushed aside, but are not to be missed. Last week’s Faces Places was one of these neglected films. This week, I’d like to bring attention to Sally Potter’s The Party – a deep, rich, tragi-comedy that came out in 2017, and was considered by many to be one of the truly superlative films of the past year. If you have missed Sally Potter’s films, and are a cinema person, you must go back and find them. Potter is an artist (trained in dance, theater, and cinema), who happens to practice largely in the cinematic medium. Over the years, she has become legendary for her complex and captivating films that include classics like Orlando (1992), and The Tango Lesson (1997) – to name two. Last year, Potter released this intimate, seven actor only, living room drama starring the cream of thespians, her fellow British compatriots that include Timothy Spall, Kristen Scott-Thomas, Emily Mortimer, and Cillian Murphy. The film, a tense, darkly comic drama, centres around a special lunch that is arranged by Kristen Scott Thomas’s character, Janet, who has just been appointed to the post of shadow Minister of Health. Her husband, Bill, played by Timothy Spall, sits in their living room playing records as Janet prepares her celebratory lunch, and fields congratulatory phone calls from friends, acquaintances, and her secret lover. As their friends arrive, the tight knit group talk about their ideologies, beliefs and hopes for the country now that Janet is in a position to make a difference, and field kitchen fires, home fires, and many other crises that emerge moment after moment, putting everyone on edge, and necessitating nail biting nervous laughter from the viewers. This is the sort of writing that one might expect from the famous Irish playwright turned film-maker Martin McDonagh, but Potter, who wrote the screenplay singlehandedly proves to be adept at yoking together humour and tragedy, giving backbone to the film that another more superficial writer-director would have failed at. The film, shot entirely in black and white, within the confines of the seven-person ensemble, and Janet and Bill’s lower ground floor home, is almost more suited for the stage than cinema. Yet the antics of these brilliant actors blossom in front of the camera, and the film comes to life, leaving all of us wondering what the heck is going on, and how things might end –making for a truly refreshing film from the mind of one of the great art-house directors of our time.

https://www.nepalitimes.com/must-see/solo-a-star-wars-story/,Solo: A Star Wars Story,"June 1, 2018","The new film about Han Solo, one of the most beloved characters of the Star Wars universe, starts off slowly and is, to be quite frank, a bit boring during its opening sequences. As I watched the dull, clichéd origin story of Han Solo (played to the best of his ability, by Alden Ehrenreich  ) unfold, I felt dread that this film could possibly ruin what started off promisingly as a fun, more than competent possible future classic addition to the Star Wars universe precipitated by Disney’s acquisition of Lucasfilm. Fortunately, the film picks up after Han finally meets his real true love, the furry Chewbacca, who more or less steals the show with his expressive moans in a few memorable, hilarious scenes. Thankfully, Ehrenreich’s Han is not alone, his other first true love, Qi’ra, who significantly ups the quality on show, is played by the lovely and immensely likable Emilia Clarke, who made her name through the Game of Thrones  TV adaptations as Daenerys Targaryen. As the two battle to stay together in a universe that is incredibly cruel to those who do not wield power, money, and have access to coaxium- a super fuel that powers a ship’s ability to jump into hyper-space, they meet a few characters that have now become part of the Star Wars lore, starting with Lando Calrissian (played by Donald Grover), and, of course, the Millenium Falcon, who by now should be acknowledged as a character in her own right. Things pick up, there are surprises, none of which I can relay here, partly because that would spoil your fun, and partly because outside of the Star Wars fan universe, I would sound crazy trying to distill a complex plot involving glowing fuel, distant universes, strange galaxies, light speed, and sassy droids to a reader base that may not be able to process that level of fantastical space related detail in mere written form. The main problem here, even when the film takes off, pardon the pun, is that Ehrenreich is no Harrison Ford, and just as this year’s Tomb Raider mistakenly cast the dull as ditchwater Alicia Vikander, who could not live up to her predecessor, the scintillating, simmering Angelina Jolie, so too is Ehrenreich cursed by the shadow of Ford, though admittedly he never falls as short as Vikander’s execrably bland Lara Croft. The film is set up for further cinematic development, and I for one would jump at the chance to see more of Chewy, Lando, Qi’ra, and another young woman who comes late into the film but is so riveting that it would be worth a sequel just to see more of her. Do not be discouraged, if you can get through the first interminable twenty-five minutes of this particular Star Wars film, you’ll have a lot of fun. So enjoy your Star Wars immersion: I found myself thinking about the film later on, and wondering how the characters might develop, always a good sign for a film that began so woefully.

https://www.nepalitimes.com/must-see/a-quiet-place/,A Quiet Place,"June 22, 2018","It had been a while since I’d seen a decent horror movie, so I jumped at the chance to go and watch A Quiet Place in theaters. The John Krasinski directed film stars his wife, the super-talented Emily Blunt, giving us all the more reason to see this unusual film that cleverly wields the tool of quietness to uncanny effect. The film feels initially quite odd in that it is more a lyrical, rather beautiful, tale about a family unit that has to survive a horrific circumstance than a formulaic horror movie. That serves as the film’s main strength today when where we are fed up with gross horror movies that disgust rather than terrify. The world has been taken over by blind, but gigantic, vicious insect-like creatures (clearly inspired by the original extra-terrestrials from Ridley Scott’s Alien films) that operate through their keen sense of hearing. They attack at any significant noise, reducing the central characters, the Abbot family, to using sign language, something they are skilled at because the eldest daughter, Regan (Millicent Simmonds), was born deaf. Due to this inadvertent survival skill, the Abbots, led by two exceptional parents, Lee and Evelyn (Krasinski and Blunt) are able to continue an idyllic life on their farm in the American country-side, albeit very, very silently, cut off from the rest of humanity. While the film’s strength is its break from the dull formula of horror, the stupid mistakes made in horror films seem ingrained in the genre. Without giving too much away, it seems safe to say that at some point in the narrative the Abbot family loses a child, and then Evelyn becomes pregnant again. Just around the time that she is due, Lee insists on leaving her, and taking their timid son Marcus (Noah Jupe) into the wild to show him some survival skills. Never mind the inherent gender bias in this decision, it seems demented to leave one’s wife alone to deal with a process which is painful, messy, and as anyone with half a brain knows, extremely LOUD. There are twists and surprises here, but small ones, and for the most part, the film was not as scary as I had expected, nor as deeply original as I might have liked. That being said, the performance of the Abbot children, and Blunt, are exceptional. Krasinski’s direction is remarkably subtle for a horror movie, although his character is slightly too silent and macho for my taste. In general this is an interesting film and quite an accomplishment for someone who is known for his acting rather than directing credentials. As for breaking the boundaries of horror, well, we’ll have to wait for another film to do that. This is to be enjoyed, screeched at, and applauded for not falling into the sinkhole of gore and trite delivery. What a shame it couldn’t go that extra mile.

https://www.nepalitimes.com/must-see/faces-places/,Faces Places,"May 11, 2018","Every reviewer who is not located at a city which is naturally at the forefront of cinema will tell you that sometimes they struggle to bring attention to the best, and most relevant, cinema to their readers and viewers – on a weekly basis. At a time when Avengers: Infinity War has been in the theaters for several weekends and the remaining titles are Damaru ko Dandibiyo, Kohalpur Express, Shatru Gate, and Rampage – I prefer, rightly or wrongly, depending on how much you might gain from such decisions, to bring attention to films that are not immediately available at their time of release but find their way into our markets in various ways for intrepid cinephiles who are on the lookout. Recommended to me by a movie-loving friend who saw it when it came out in cinemas in France last year, right after it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival (outside of competition but winning an accolade nevertheless), Faces Places is a film worth chasing down. A documentary made by the legendary Agnès Varda – now in her late 80s, in collaboration with her friend, the 35-year-old French artist known only as JR, Faces Places or Visages Villages as it is titled in French, is the story of two artists, undaunted by their age differences, who decide to travel across France, meeting their fellow countrywomen and men, and creating art out of the faces and occupations of these quotidian but quietly extraordinary lives. JR prints the photos of the people they meet, and with his skilled team, watched over by Varda’s unerring cinematographer’s eye, these images are pasted onto the edifices of people’s towns, homes, monuments, and sometimes the abandoned ruins that used to house entire communities. The project sounds simple, maybe even facile, but in the hands of more ambitious, less artistic people (documentary makers are often ruthless in the manipulation of their subjects: but not these two young at heart, old souls) it could have gone wrong. Instead, the film meanders along at its own pace, the two friends converse over where to go, unafraid of boring the viewer, tease each other mercilessly, and together bring out the most tender and human aspect of themselves, and their subjects, resulting in breath-taking portraits of the people and the places they live in. Faces Places was rightly nominated in the Best Documentary category this year, but this piece of information is only included in my review to convince the sceptics who might be holding out till now. While it did not win, the film is such a piece of beauty in an ugly world that it is worth finding, and viewing. It is also a chance to see one of Agnès Varda’s films – her other films are not as accessible, even while Cleo from 5 to 7 (1961) is one of the great masterpieces of cinema, a dream of a film that follows the life of a woman, moment by moment, through her day: the kind of daring, insouciant, perfectly crafted film that every art-house filmmaker dreams of making. Readers interested in Nepal and its issues, in print or online, perhaps may wonder at the point of watching a film about French blue-collar workers. I guess, I would say, the wider your viewing, the more you can open your heart. So go out and seek.       Publisher and Chief Editor: Kunda Dixit

https://www.nepalitimes.com/must-see/the-hurricane-heist/,The Hurricane Heist,"June 8, 2018","Rob Cohen’s latest action film is a case in point about how sometimes perfectly fine films can bomb at the box-office. With a name like The Hurricane Heist, the film certainly doesn’t do itself any favours, and the cast, though very good, are relatively unknown. There are memorable cases of classics going up in flames at the box office: I suspect that last year’s dreamy, transcendent space opera Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets directed by the truly great Luc Besson will figure in the future as one of the major sci-fi classics of our time. Not that The Hurricane Heist is a classic in any real sense, it’s just a decent action flick. Better than most in fact, that ought to keep spectators suitably rapt in their seats as the clever premise unfolds. A category five hurricane is unfurling in rural Alabama, treasury agents led by the charming, immensely likable Maggie Grace as Casey Corbyn, are transporting $600 million worth of old bank notes to a federal facility to be shredded, two brothers who lost their father in the last big storm are trying to make amends, traitors lurk in their midst – and everyone gets caught up in both the hurricane and the heist as the world goes to pot. The younger of the aforementioned two brothers, Will Rutledge (Toby Kebbel), is now a meteorologist in a nod to his tragic past, and as he and Casey serendipitously cross paths, they team up to face grim odds and one really vicious villain to save the day. What makes this film durable throughout is that it doesn’t follow the usual trajectory of action movies these days, and it thankfully does not wallow in a long fight right at the end.Grace and Kebbel are great as action heroes, their chemistry together is strong and Grace in particular is a star in the making. While I do not mean to damn this film with faint praise, I will say that although I thoroughly enjoyed it, do not expect any thing more than an action filled ride with lots of surprises and special effects that show what a nightmare a natural disaster like that can be. So, while Deadpool 2 is still in theaters here, save your money by settling back into the comfort of your home screen and relax into a few hours of pretty good entertainment.

https://www.nepalitimes.com/must-see/the-post/,The Post,"April 13, 2018","2017 was a good year for cinema. Among the nine films nominated for Best Picture almost all, barring the unnecessarily long Dunkirk, are special in their particular ways. Each of these films is distinctive in style, guided by the voices of their directors who want to push the boundaries of what can be done on film. Steven Spielberg’s The Post is probably one of the most conventional of the films nominated this past year. Fortunately, it is so strong in its subject matter and in the force of the actors who guide the story that the film excels in its own right, even while it did not win the coveted golden statue. Starring the great Meryl Streep and the wonderful Tom Hanks, The Post tells the incredible true story of how The Washington Post threw aside all caution to publish the Pentagon Papers in 1971, papers that exposed how the White House administrations, extending back to Harry Truman, through to the current administration (at the time) of Richard Nixon had been aware that the Vietnam war was a lost cause. The thousands of pages long, comprehensive report had been commissioned in 1967 by the then Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood), who had held off exposing this dreadful secret that would surely have brought down any sitting president. After The New York Times is barred by a court injunction from further publishing the strategically leaked papers, The Post’s editor in Chief Ben Bradlee (Hanks) lobbies, hard, for Katherine Graham (Streep), the first female owner of any publication, to allow the paper to publish the hundreds of crucial stories that the report might generate. This is a story about bravery, and doing what’s right, told without hyperbole, in the most matter of fact, but stirring of ways. Hanks and Streep square off as adversary and confidante, switching back and forth as each struggles with his or her ethics, trying to draw lines about how far they will go to expose the truth or retain their hard won space in the echelons of political society. There is a particularly riveting line, uttered by the former military analyst Daniel Ellsberg (played by another great actor, Matthew Rhys), the original source who leaked the papers to The New York Times, when he says that to accuse a paper of betraying a president and committing crimes against the state is dangerously close to the President saying “I am the state” – a dreadful defaulting on the real tenet of democracy where the state is actually the people, who elect the head of state to represent their best interests. This is particularly prescient in present day America. There is so much to love about The Post, the performances, the fascinating procedural revelations about how such stories are told by a truly committed media, the will of a woman to do the right thing, the reporters who bite on to the truth like little terriers that won’t let go, and finally the insights into why people are sometimes noble, despite our fears.

https://www.nepalitimes.com/must-see/avengers-infinity-war-2/,Avengers: Infinity  War,"May 4, 2018","The only really annoying thing about this new Avengers film is that it has a problematic structural device, which, if you didn’t know about (like this reviewer) will leave you extremely disconcerted. Aside from that, the film is very enjoyable indeed, though more for the super fans who can remember all the ins and outs of the previous eighteen Marvel films that essentially build up to this one. Astonishingly, for a film that is 156 minutes long, time flies by – indicating how entertaining this film is – even while there are few really memorable moments. For those who are wondering who is in this film, the answer is: everyone. All of our favourite and not-so-favourite characters from previous films come together in Avengers: Infinity War, including the team from the Guardians of the Galaxy (2014, 2017) who are my personal favourites, along with Thor (Chris Helmsworth), Loki (Tom Hiddleston), The Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Robert Downey Jr. aka Iron Man, and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) to name about half of this mind-boggling cast. Over the last couple of Marvel films, the plot has always been followed by a clue regarding the whereabouts of some of the six infinity stones that are placed around the universe. In this film, we find out what they are and how they came to be, finally, in a satisfactory explanation about why they yield such awesome power. Unfortunately, the brutish war criminal and genocide proponent Thanos (played by Josh Brolin), who is also, alas, the adoptive father of Gamora (Zoe Saldana), one of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and beloved of Peter Quill aka Starlord (Chris Pratt), has discovered where most of the stones lay hidden and comes into possession of them one by one. Many sub-stories and emotional arcs are woven into this complex narrative, an achievement that should not be taken lightly by critics who may not appreciate the kind of care and skill that must go into such a daunting undertaking. Amongst some breath-taking action, and a few really good jokes, lives are lost, hearts are broken, real evil is conveyed to the viewers, and the afore-mentioned structural flaw is a shock ending that leaves us in medias res – wondering what could possibly happen in the sequel due out on the 3rd of May next year that could resolve such a mess. These Marvel films are meant as pure fun, not as works of art. Occasionally they lag, they are shamelessly exploitative in their constant generation of sequels, but occasionally a classic comes along – justifying it all. It remains to be seen, till next year, if this installment, itself a sequel generating film, will be regarded as one of them. I personally, however, can’t wait to see it again.

https://www.nepalitimes.com/must-see/darkest-hour/,Darkest hour,"April 27, 2018","If ever there was a feel good movie about Winston Churchill, the Oscar nominated film Darkest Hour would be it. A story about Churchill’s travails during arguably the lowest point in the war, the film lifts up the viewer giving us an intimate, moving, intense, sometimes somewhat historically inaccurate story about Churchill’s rise to fame that made him a household name, even today. Directed by Joe Wright and starring Gary Oldman, in the performance of his career as Churchill, which won him the Best Actor award this year, Darkest Hour will hold you rapt (even if you know the outcome of events), riveted by Oldman whose every moment on screen is as precious as gold. Wright’s direction has always had style, he is the director of Atonement (2007) among others, and his sure sense of visuals brings this film out of what could have been the boring confines of a biopic. As a result, we have a carefully put together film that tells the story of the crisis that Britain is plunged into when the entire British infantry was cornered by the Germans, their only refuge being the beach at Dunkirk. As hinted by the title, the situation is dire: three hundred thousand men, and with them Britain’s only real hope of defense against the Germans, are left stranded at Dunkirk, the then Conservative Party Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain is forced to step down for being too soft on the Nazis, and the Conservative Party’s only viable candidate turns out be Winston Churchill, a man who, at the time, did not command the respect he does now due to his track record of errors at Gallipoli, and his stance on India. The film portrays Churchill’s struggle through a nightmarish moment in Britain’s history at a time when defeat and massive loss of life seemed imminent, and even while we know they come out of it, it is still nerve-wracking to watch these events unfold, almost felling the new Prime Minister with each new development. How Churchill perseveres, aided by those closest to him including his wife Clementine (Kristen Scott Thomas), and his secretary Elizabeth Layton, played by the lovely Lily James, who takes dictation and transcribes his now famous speeches, gives us the effect of seeing into his innermost life, even while it is mostly fictionalised, bringing us to a greater understanding of this character who clearly had his flaws but was perhaps the only person who could have helmed Britain through World War II, with his particular pugnacity, perseverance, thick-skinned carelessness, and extreme loyalty to king and country. Do not expect a bore of a film just because you think you know the story. Once you start, you are in the hands of a master, one that will make you feel you know this famous man, and want to become friends with him, indulging his voracious appetite, and even his little fibs because to be great means to have flaws and to overcome them.

https://www.nepalitimes.com/must-see/pacific-rim-uprising/,Pacific Rim Uprising,"May 25, 2018","Deadpool 2 is out, and despite its legion of fans, despair permeates my heart when I think of just how stupid the first film really was, despite being pretty funny. If you liked it, apologies: go ahead and enjoy it – we are all free to do, think and watch as we wish. However, if I had to pick a sequel, which I did in protest of Deadpool 2 in the cinema, I chose Pacific Rim Uprising  which came out this March as a sequel to Guillermo del Toro ’s magnificent, heart pounding film Pacific Rim from 2013, which was perfect in every way except for a flawed ending. This new, unnecessary installment, produced by del Toro and directed by Steven S. DeKnight , was therefore something I approached with a great deal of trepidation. Surprisingly enough, despite a slow start that almost made me abandon the film, the film is fairly decent for those who love the genius that made the first film so riveting. Based on the premise that humans must build gigantic people controlled robots to fight off the monstrous, amphibian-like, but organic Kaiju that emerge from a breach in the Pacific Rim (one that leads to another alien world, don’t get me started, that would take another column), the film retains the adrenaline activating glory of seeing two pilots syncing together (or drifting) to control these huge robots. The action of seeing the characters operating these robots is particularly attractive for those who are looking for a new, cooler type of action than what one would normally see in say, Deadpool 2. To return to the film at hand though, the main reason Pacific Rim Uprising is so successful is the presence of the very talented John Boyega  (lately of Star Wars fame), who plays Jake Pentecost, the son of Stacker Pentecost (played by the great Idris Elba  in the first film) – a Jaeger pilot who returns to service when a terrifying new crisis emerges. Caught up in becoming a great pilot like his legendary father, Boyega’s character is incredibly likeable and attractive due to his biting British humour, and his relative lack of masculine machismo, a major turn-off in most action movies. You don’t have to see this film in the cinema, you can enjoy it at home. If you want to see on screen, so be it, but if you can’t face the smart alecky humour of Ryan Reynold – magnified manifold by the big screen, then here’s an alternative to satisfy your tastes for watchable but not particularly memorable action cinema.

https://www.nepalitimes.com/must-see/call-me-by-your-name/,Call me by your name,"April 20, 2018","What can I say about Luca Guadagnino’s Call Me By Your Name without being accused of sounding hopelessly enamoured of this most true and tender of love stories? To get the particulars out of the way and move on to the dreamy stuff of the film itself, Call Me By Your Name was adapted by the great James Ivory from a novel by André Aciman, and while Ivory deserves a column to himself for the wonderful films he’s written and directed, A Room With A View (1986) and Remains of the Day (1993) being among my most treasured period films, I must move on from my lingering nostalgia for these lusciously orchestrated, exquisitely crafted films. Nominated as one of the nine films in the Best Picture category this year (it lost to The Shape of Water), Guadagnino’s observant, funny, warm, audaciously intellectual and sensual film is about a relationship between two young men, the seventeen year old Elio (Timothée Chalamet), and a young American graduate student, Oliver (Armie Hammer),who comes to stay with Elio’s parents and help his cerebral archaeologist father in a small town in northern Italy. Most films are successful because their scripts are strong, here the film has the added benefit (in addition to Ivory’s dazzling, almost virtuoso writing) of being shot in keeping with the actual sequence of events (as opposed to a schedule that prioritises the proximity and availability of locations), and on a single 35mm lens that allows for wide shots that enable the actors to roam outside the usual constraints, allowing for an ease and spontaneity that can sometimes be absent from more traditional set-ups. While a film like Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread benefits from such structure, Call Me By Your Name thrives and comes alive under this kind of direction, giving the viewer a sense of closely getting to know the characters as they move through their sun-drenched idyllic lives, that is, until both Elio and Oliver fall helplessly in love with each other against their own better judgement. This is not the usual, cloying ‘coming of age’ film where Elio enters into a rite of passage that opens the doorway into his adulthood, it is instead an exploration of what it means to fall deeply in love, and all the uncertainties, bliss, heartache, and glory that surrounds this mind-altering human act. While the film is indeed the unforgettable story of Elio and Oliver, it is supported by an indescribably fine supporting cast including a gentle, wise performance by Michael Stuhlbard as Elio’s erudite father Mr. Perlman, and the gorgeous Amira Casar as his brilliant, stunning, compassionate mother, Annella. Call Me By Your Name like all genuine works of art, is a story that is not bound by the gender of its protagonists, though it is defined in some ways by the luscious depictions of the Italian countryside. One could argue that few films go wrong in such a setting, but that kind of negativity is for the small of heart.        Publisher and Chief Editor: Kunda Dixit

When it came out in theaters this year, children flocked to see this beloved story rendered on film. Determined to see what the fuss was all about, I read the book before I watched the movie, finally understanding the draw of this special, fantastical, science-based tale about a peculiar family who love each other so fiercely that they transcend the natural laws of physics. The story begins with the portrayal of a near perfect family. Not the boring kind we see onscreen sitting down for dinner together every night and bickering: albeit lovingly, but the kind that deal with everything difficult with actual explanations, and above all, humour. Meg Murray (Storm Reid) is the eldest daughter of astro-physicists Alex (Chris Pine) and Kate Murray (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). While experimenting with travelling across the universe, Alex Murray disappears one fine day, when his son Charles Wallace is but an infant. With a strong intellect of her own, the cute precocious child Meg transforms into the teenage Meg over the four years that her father has been gone, and begins to fade into an oblivion of grief and resentment – a combination that is disastrous in a budding teenager. Her only real consolation is her six-year-old brother Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe), a prodigy who speaks in full sentences, has some uncanny precognitive abilities, and is essentially the family’s protector. As their mother mourns quietly, putting on a brave face for her children, and Meg buries her teenage self into a quagmire of despondency, Charles Wallace keeps everyone going with his hot milk, deep empathy, and sandwich making abilities. When he appears one stormy night with an eccentric, bubbly, magical woman named Mrs Whatsit (played with such fun by Reese Witherspoon), it marks the beginning of the children’s journey to find their father, hand in hand with Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who (Mindy Kaling), Mrs Which (Oprah Winfrey), and a young boy named Calvin O’Keefe (Levi Miller) who sees Meg for who she really is: a bright, lovely, soul. The children’s journey in space, deemed unfilmable, is distilled and rendered quite beautifully through DuVernay’s keen eyes, a feat that not everyone could have pulled off considering the level of abstract imagery in the original content. These visuals, together with the ensemble cast that work so well together, make for a rather extraordinary viewing experience, and a satisfying one for anyone who fell in love with the book. Ava DuVernay is the first black woman to direct a Hollywood movie with a budget of over $100 million, and she brings her unmistakable stamp to a film where the characters would otherwise most probably have been cast as white by default. Instead, by bringing in actors of many colours (Mindy Kaling, Oprah Winfrey, Storm Reid, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, and Deric McCabe), DuVernay lends a completeness to an already universal story about the power of love. A -Wrinkle In Time is a must-see for your children, but also for yourselves. Of course, as always, you must read L’Engle’s enchanting books first! A Wrinkle in Time is only the first of a quintet: I myself can’t wait to dive into the remaining four books.      Publisher and Chief Editor: Kunda Dixit

https://www.nepalitimes.com/must-see/phantom-thread/,Phantom Thread,"April 6, 2018","While I greatly admire Paul Thomas Anderson’s films (the incredibly cheeky Boogie Nights from 1997 is my favourite), I began his latest film, 2017’s Phantom Thread with a little bit of trepidation, imagining a film that yet again deals with the masculine ego, thriving on its complexities. While Phantom Thread is indeed about a very masculine ego, that of Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis in what could be his last role), a designer of one of the great eponymous (and fictitious) British Fashion Houses of the 1950s, it is also much more than that, surprising me at every turn, even as I was enraptured by the beauty of the film and the complexity of the characters. Nominated this year in the category for Best Picture at the 90th Academy Awards, Phantom Thread lost to Guillermo del Toro’s fantastical, lovely Shape of Water in a year where the Best Picture nominees have been incredibly strong and represented a wide range of cinema at its best, though arguably, of course, it could have been more diverse. For the ever-critical who insist on not being able to relate to a film unless there is a person the same colour as themselves onscreen, Phantom Thread might dismay as it is a film about three very contrary and complex white people who indeed are dealing with the first world problems of love, identity, success, failure, and their place in the world. Luckily, Anderson, being the great director that he is, is able to make the story transcendent, creating a riveting psycho-drama about what it is to love somebody but to also retain one’s dignity and sense of self in the process- a difficult balance once you understand that even the best of love involves some kind of power dynamic. When Reynolds falls in love with a young, seemingly ordinary waitress Alma, played by the wonderfully talented Austrian newcomer Vicky Krieps, we are tricked into thinking that she is just one of a long line of ingénues that he uses as a blank canvas for his haute couture dresses. Alma however, is made up of some unusual stuff and therefore we have a film which surprises at every turn, confounding us just when we think we know what is going to happen next. The relationships here, written by Anderson, who also shot this beautiful film, are woven with care and understanding of how contrary people can be. It is a pleasure to be baffled by every dramatic turn in a film that showcases the talents of three extraordinary actors, Day-Lewis, Krieps, and the great Leslie Manville as Cyril Woodcock, keeper of the gate of the House of Reynolds and Woodcock’s bosom confidante and sister. This is not a film for the impatient or for those who expect a conventional love story. It is instead a work of art that yields surprises, probably with every viewing, with an extraordinary mixture of art, fashion, clashing egos, love, rivalry, and the unexpected role of wild, poisonous mushrooms. If you are in the mood for a luscious, extremely bizarre love story, this is going to be your film of the year.       Publisher and Chief Editor: Kunda Dixit

https://www.nepalitimes.com/must-see/tomb-raider/,Tomb Raider,"March 30, 2018","As a lapsed filmmaker, it is hard to trash a movie, knowing how much sweat, hard-work and sleepless nights go into the making of any film, good or bad. This year’s Tomb Raider reboot though, starring the young, lovely Alicia Vikander, falls short of the original iterations that starred Angelina Jolie, those past ones having a verve and sassy insouciance (stemming mostly from Jolie’s tongue in cheek performance) that is sadly lacking in this new, dim, woefully boring adaptation. Roar Uthang’s formulaic adaptation is hard to watch, it is that uninteresting. Meant as an origin story that describes Lara Croft’s (Alicia Vikander) evolution into the highly trained explorer of the beloved video games from where her character originates, the script lacks originality, taking from hackneyed tropes like a missing father figure, a surly child that suffers from a peripatetic parent, and a lost treasure on a hard to reach island. Lara Croft’s overall charm has always been tied, in addition to her bold and sexy persona, to the extreme charm of Croft Manor, a beautiful English Country house that is rigged out with the latest gadgets to support her roving adventures. Few of these elements appear in the film aside from redundant flash backs where Lara is remembering her father showing his affection by way of first kissing his fore and middle fingers, and then touching her forehead (a gesture so often repeated, that it will make you want to scream towards the end of the film) in front of Croft Manor. As Lara sets off to find her father who was last heard of on a small island in the Japanese territories, she takes the help of a fisherman Lu Ren (played with charisma by Daniel Wu) who reluctantly agrees to take her to the island on his beat up boat. Disaster follows along with terrible choices by the evil guys, all of whom are as flat as comic book characters, or video game avatars. To say that this film is a snooze is to be kind, I found myself often wanting to either doze off or walk out. Vikander is a talented actress. Her success as a rising star is probably unhindered by this film, which she agreed to do because she was promised a “gritty, realistic” origin story. But unfortunately, this film is a waste of talent and time, a project doomed from the start of its dreary, insipid script.        Publisher and Chief Editor: Kunda Dixit

https://www.nepalitimes.com/must-see/red-sparrow/,Red sparrow,"March 23, 2018","Jennifer Lawrence has become a mega-star, and while at 27 she is still too inexperienced to be the next Meryl Streep (could anyone really be as good as Streep?) she is ever versatile, constantly changing the kinds of roles she picks, pushing her boundaries in a way that is impressive, and the trait of a truly great artist. Occasionally she misses, like in 2017’s truly awful Mother! – a shamefully indulgent piece of exploitative cinema by the usually sensitive Darren Aronofsky. But her willingness to work for an unconventional film-maker like him shows the grit that she first exhibited in her break-through role in Deborah Granik’s intense thriller Winter’s Bone (2010), a film to find and watch if you have not seen it yet. Seven years later, Lawrence is capable of commanding films that are vehicles for her talent, underscoring her riveting presence onscreen. With Francis Lawrence’s ambitious Red Sparrow this actress shows that she can play a number of different aspects of a character without the showiness that can be annoying in the likes of the Johnny Depps and the Leonardo DiCaprios who insist on calling attention to their apparently multitudinous talent. Red Sparrow itself is a paced, classic thriller with a streak of violence. Using the current cold war with Russia as a premise, the film tells the story of a prima ballerina, Dominika Egerova (Lawrence), who loses her dream of dancing after a terrible injury onstage. Used by the state who wields her ailing mother (the great Joely Richardson) over her head, Dominika ends up joining the ‘Sparrow’ program, a noxious, wholly unethical exercise designed to turn men and women into proverbial ‘honey pots’, but much worse, teaching them skills of manipulation that are both humiliating and deeply damaging to both executor and recipient. Dominika excels, she is tough and smart, and her survival skills take her through a series of ordeals and missions that bring her in close contact with other devious Sparrows, a handsome CIA agent, Nick Nash (Joel Edgerton), and a corrupt US bureaucrat. The film takes its time, so those who expect the adrenaline pumping of an Atomic Blonde (2017) kind of film will perhaps be disappointed. But this story, based on the 2013 novel by Jason Matthews, is actually a first rate thriller, albeit, to those who are attuned to the inherent sexism in Hollywood, pretty skewed in terms of its exploitative tendencies under the pseudo-guise of empowerment. Luckily, aside from a few misguided moments, this does not last, and Dominika compels the viewer and the characters within the narrative like the star that she is. Laced with a strong cast including the legendary Jeremy Irons and the immensely talented Matthias Schoenaerts, Red Sparrow stayed in my mind long after it ended, creating a nostalgia for its world, and the characters in it. I wanted to know more about what happens to them next, I ended up caring deeply about their lives. I would say that is the trait of a good film.       Publisher and Chief Editor: Kunda Dixit

https://www.nepalitimes.com/must-see/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri/,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","March 16, 2018","When I first saw the Irish playwright Martin McDonagh’s Lieutenant of Inishmore on stage in New York in 2006, I never imagined that this brilliant, sharp, funny, melodic, verbose writer would make the jump into cinema. His work seemed made for the stage, with characters and patterns speaking beautiful, articulate sentences more suited for theater than cinema. Imagine my surprise then, on him winning the Best Screenplay award this year at the Oscars for the spine-chillingly poignant, belly achingly funny film which he also directed, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri – a heartbreaking film about a woman who goes all out to find her daughter’s rapist and killer. Mildred Hayes (played in a feral, funny, riveting, unforgettable performance by Frances McDormand who won the Best Actress Oscar for her role) is infuriated by the lack of progress from the town police in the brutal murder of her teenage daughter Angela. Separated from her drunken abusive husband and consumed by grief at the loss of her daughter, Mildred puts down a payment of $5000 to paint an accusing series of signs on three billboards just outside the town – shaming the town police who have no leads even months after the killing. Needless to say, the small insular town is aghast at her brazen, unrepentant attitude on accusing one of the town’s most beloved members, Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) of ineptitude. It also doesn’t help that Chief Willoughby is dying of cancer. The film follows a tight, sharp dramatic arc that includes unforgettable performances from a cast of actors who play the town’s kooky characters in a story about how revenge can consume, and forgiveness can redeem. Sam Rockwell, another under the radar but incredibly fine actor won for Best Supporting Actor playing Officer Jason Dixon- a bigoted policeman whose life is changed by Mildred’s vendetta. McDonagh does the almost impossible, which is to create a deep, dark film about violence, loss, racism, brutality and sexism, lacing it with irreverent humour and a complete, compassionate understanding of the flaws of humanity. McDonagh understands that “No man is as bad as his worst act” – but nevertheless everyone must pay for their actions if they have morals: for the immoral sociopaths, there is no reprieve. All of McDonagh’s films, including the hilariously funny and incredibly bleak In Bruges (2008), are suited almost more for theater than for cinema. Yet this film manages to be a powerful work onscreen: it creates a sense of place so strong that one believes McDonagh’s version of Bruges and quiet Ebbing, Missouri are out there somewhere. While Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri lost in the Best Picture category to The Shape of Water, it is as worthy a contender, if not more deserving. For those who want to see a real masterpiece this year, this is the film to watch. Do not miss this film, it is the stuff of legend.      Publisher and Chief Editor: Kunda Dixit

https://www.nepalitimes.com/must-see/the-shape-of-water/,The Shape of Water,"March 9, 2018","How does one begin to describe Guillermo del Toro’s wondrous, magical new film The Shape of Water ? While the bare bones of it is a deeply unconventional love story between a mute woman and an uncannily man-like water creature, the reality of the story is a delicate fairy tale about why we fall in love, and why love can make us do things that we wouldn’t ordinarily do. Since his beautiful and terrifying Pan’s Labyrinth (2006), there are a legion of fervent followers of his films because, quite frankly, no other mainstream director has the kind of bold cinematic, risk-taking vision that del Toro has repeatedly exhibited ranging from films like Hellboy (2004), to 2013’s heart-pounding Pacific Rim – a film that took action and special effects to another level, bringing del Toro’s vivid, eccentric imagination to an audience who were spellbound. It is therefore astonishing and ideal that The Shape of Water won The Best Picture Award from the Academy last Sunday, considering that the film is anything but a conventional classic that Hollywood usually swoons over, even while it employs the tropes of a traditional love story. The story begins underwater in a tour de force of cinematography as the narrator prepares us for a tale of watery longing and loss. Quickly and efficiently we are then introduced to the mute but warm and incredibly emotive Elisa (the great Sally Hawkins, who was also justly nominated as Best Actress this year but lost fair and square to Frances McDormand), who lives on her own next door to her best friend, Giles (the also amazing Richard Jenkins). The two look after each other as Jenkins struggles with his alcoholism and another secret while Elisa goes to work at night as a cleaner at a secretive government laboratory. Set during the Cold War in 1962, the lab is a cold forbidding place made warmer by Elisa’s friendship with her feisty fellow cleaner Zelda (the lovely Octavia Spencer), who stands up for her silent friend whose main downfall is her dreaminess. Things start to change upon the arrival of a mysterious creature in a water tank — one that is both vicious and tender, depending on who is dealing with him. Suffice to say that one just doesn’t quite know what is going to happen next in this film that is wrought with such care, and laced with so much tension, supported by a cast of characters who are played by the best of the best when it comes to thespians. The Shape Water is the kind of film which you watch while biting your nails, laughing with delight, feeling heartsick, all the while unsure of where it is taking you, until it ends, haunts you in your dreams and then makes you want to watch all the good bits over and over again. This is the stuff of dreams and nightmares both – bits of imagination boiled over from a savant’s head and onto pure cinema. It is a film about outsiders, their friendships and their loves, told with the most sensitive heart. It is a real pleasure to finally see a film that deserves to win accolades after so long.

https://www.nepalitimes.com/must-see/lady-bird/,Lady Bird,"March 5, 2018","Greta Gerwig’s funny, sweet, kind-hearted feature Lady Bird Saoirse Ronan has been nominated in the five most prestigious categories for the upcoming 90th Academy Awards on 4 March this Sunday — for those interested in still watching this interminable ceremony. There is a Best Picture nomination, along with one for Best Director for Gerwig, and two nominations for Saoirse Ronan for Best Actress as the titular lead. Yet another nomination has been reserved for the great Laurie Metcalfe in the Best Supporting role as Lady Bird’s complex, warm hearted, hypercritical mother Marion McPherson. As a young American actor, writer, and now director, Gerwig has come far, starting off starring as an ingénue towards the beginning of her career, and now reaching perhaps the apex of her development with yet another Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay for Lady Bird’s excellent, lucid script. This is a classic American coming-of-age film about a young girl named Christine who insists on being called Lady Bird for the sake of her own individuality. While there are moments of great beauty and real transcendence in the film, aided by some exceptional writing by Gerwig, this is essentially the kind of high-school film that resonates mainly with an American audience, even while the carefully written chemistry between Lady Bird and her mother Marion ensures it captivates the older people as well. The other travails of Lady Bird, such as being born to a lower middle class but still privileged family, going to a Catholic school, and living in Sacramento will fall flat to the eyes of young Nepali teenagers who probably have angst of their own (as do all teenagers) but not to do the same kind of extreme individualism that is seemingly an American trait which does not quite manifest to the same extent around the world — not even to Nepali teenagers who are struggling to find themselves and undoubtedly see themselves as unique in that struggle. It is therefore unfortunate that such a fine film should have such a narrow range, with little symbolism and, aside from Metcalf’s riveting Marion, few powerful archetypes to appeal to an international audience. We have become so inured to the insistent Americanism of the mainstream that most of us watch films about American life without questioning how little these films echo against our own. Cinema is meant to be universal, but without a far thinking director to wield it, the films become as narrow as the director’s viewpoint. This is perhaps an unfair criticism of Lady Bird, a film which does not pretend to be more than it is: a family drama about a young, callow girl with a good heart who goes through her share of teenage neuroses. It is a shame that these promising young American directors, like Gerwig, and her partner Noah Baumbach (the film-maker who made the equally insular The Squid and the Whale in 2005) do not look outside their world for the wealth of stories that could be told, were there a will.              Watch trailer:      Publisher and Chief Editor: Kunda Dixit

https://www.nepalitimes.com/must-see/the-age-of-shadows/,The Age of Shadows,"March 5, 2018","For those looking for something different to watch at home when there is nothing in the theatres except for a controversial Bollywood film and a tired sequel or two, the Korean film The Age of Shadows (2016) is now available in its noirish glory, all 140 minutes of it. Made as an ode to the resistance movement against the Japanese takeover over of Korea that stretched over decades in the early 20th Century, starting in 1910, the film tells the story of a team of committed fighters who will stop at nothing to release their beloved country from the possession of the haughty Japanese who rule over it, and part of China with an iron fist. The crux of the story is centred around several key figures including a resistance fighter turned policeman informant for the Japanese, Lee Jung-chool (Song Kang-ho). Lee’s allegiances are tested when he is cajoled and manipulated by the resistance fighters held together by the ingenuity and fortitude of a key figure, Kim Woo-jin (Gong Yoo), an antiques dealer who plays the game of suave businessman while organising for explosives and anarchist experts from Hungary to be smuggled from Shanghai into Seoul. Beautifully filmed with an attention to lighting and framing that echoes in the tradition of the great film noirs of the Hollywood studio system, the movie exhibits the sophistication of Korean filmmaking, underscored by great acting from the leads who take a complex, sometimes convoluted storyline and make it riveting by focusing on the strong, complicated personalities that inhabit the film. This is a story of heroism laced with an understanding of what it takes to be a resistance fighter; the film is strongest when the characters are showing their mettle, unflinching at the manipulations and hardships they have to endure in their fight for freedom. Entered by Korea for the Best Foreign Language category, but missing the nomination, this is a fine film out of a country that now produces gems of independent cinema, albeit, in this particular case, also supported by the behemoth Warner Brothers. World cinema has always pushed the boundaries of form all over the globe, and while The Age of Shadows does follow a hallowed Hollywood tradition, the film breaks boundaries in its depiction of good and bad, with Kang-ho’s character playing one of the most interesting, conflicted characters I’ve seen onscreen for a long time. It is a shame that films don’t pay more such attention to character development the world over, with Nepali films sticking to tropes that make you nauseous even watching the trailers, Bollywood films no less clichéd in their hackneyed renditions of men and women, and Hollywood, the great trend-setter and shaper of psyches all over the world no less lazy when it comes to portraying the complexity of people through our evolution. The Age of Shadows is a refreshing, grave portrait of a multifaceted set of people who are not blindly brave, making sacrifices that illuminate their humanity.

https://www.nepalitimes.com/must-see/the-beguiled/,The Beguiled,"March 5, 2018","When Sofia Coppola entered the filmmaking fray in 1999 with The Virgin Suicides she carried the enormous and difficult mantle of being the daughter of Francis Ford Coppola, one of the greatest filmmakers of our time. Six films later, she has moved beyond pigeonholes, earning her name as a sensitive, original filmmaker with a voice quite unlike any other director working today. Think of it what you may, but Lost in Translation (2003), despite accusations of it being nebulous and without substance, is one of the great films about falling in love with an entirely unsuitable person – one that is written and directed with grace, humour, and a touch of the truly offbeat that defines Coppola’s sensibilities. In 2017, Coppola’s The Beguiled made its debut at the Cannes Film Festival, winning her the coveted prize for “Best Director”, a prize won only once before by a woman at the hallowed film festival which is the arbiter of art-house cinema. A remake of a 1971 film by the same name, The Beguiled is a tense, gothic thriller set in the American Civil War, chronicling the story of what happens when a lone, injured soldier from the north gets absorbed into a beautiful but crumbling mansion in Virginia that houses a girl’s school where only a few students remain. The soldier, Corporal John McBurney (Colin Farrell), is initially viewed with suspicion, but slowly all the women, including the gracious Martha Farnsworth (Nicole Kidman), owner of the house and school, and Edwina Morrow (Kirsten Dunst) all begin to soften towards the charming, hard-working soldier who helps them around the garden once he begins to recovers. As the women and girls grow fond of the soldier, tensions rise, people fall in love, or lust, and as with most hothouse situations, the rot starts to manifest. But, unlike other films of the kind, things do not spiral downwards into atrocious clichés, guided by Coppola’s unerring touch, and the great Kidman and Dunst, the film reveals hidden character and brings out nuances that might have gone down the drain at the hands of a more drama-oriented director who might have set effect over affect and ruined everything. As a result, The Beguiled becomes a much more interesting film than what one might have imagined, bringing little surprises to a thriller that benefits from the lightness of the stellar ensemble acting by the women. Colin Farrell does well here as a louche but charming Irish mercenary who falls into the laps of seven women who grow to adore him, but are betrayed by his basic instincts. While I can understand why The Beguiled won Coppola her “Best Director” award, with its subtle direction and absolutely beautiful mise-en-scène, it is not one of her best films, unlike the great Marie Antoinette or the sensitive Somewhere – both of which show her distinctive auteurship which takes her out of the category of being Francis Ford’s daughter and puts her on the same list as Jane Campion and Kathryn Bigelow. At this time of awards season fervour, watch The Beguiled if you want to support the smaller films that actually make cinema so much more interesting.
